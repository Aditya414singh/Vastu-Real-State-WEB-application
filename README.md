# Vastu Project

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of the **Vastu** project. The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend**: The backend logic and API implementation.
- **Frontend**: The user interface and client-side logic.

Additionally, a **Socket** folder may also exist to handle real-time communication if required.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Vastu** project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for [Brief project description goes here]. The backend serves the data and handles authentication, while the frontend provides a user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Aditya414singh/Vastu.git

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend folder:

cd backend
Install the backend dependencies:


npm install
Configure environment variables by creating a .env file in the backend folder and adding your required configurations like the database URL, JWT secret, etc.

Start the backend server:

npm start
Alternatively, if you're using nodemon for auto-restarting the server:


nodemon index.js
3. Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend folder:


cd frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:


npm install
Start the frontend development server:


npm start
This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000. You can open this URL in your browser to view the frontend of the project.
